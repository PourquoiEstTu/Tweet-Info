# Tweet-Info
This is a python script with three functions in it. One counts the number of tweets each day of the month, the second counts the number of times a word appears across all tweets, and the last function counts the number of times a word is tweeted versus days of the month. There is an example JSON file included in the folder to see how the program works.
